Self-driven aspiring software/DevOps engineer and Apple enthusiast, queuing overnight to be first in line for launches of iPhone 5 and iPad 2 - eventually leading to being one of Apple’s youngest ever retail hires.

A recent Makers Academy DfE bootcamp graduate skilled in Python, TDD, OOP, and Agile. An active learner with Azure Fundamentals AZ-900, AI/LLM, and cybersecurity certifications, continuously upskilling.

Passionate problem solver who simplified complex operational problems at dentalessence. Progressed from providing efficient IT consultancy and mastering proprietary dental tech, to heading operations and spearheading transformative company-wide projects. Adept at breaking down large, distributed problems to provide exceptional customer experiences; through innovative thinking.

I’m eager to rejoin Apple’s industry leading, innovative culture and have the chance to contribute to world-class products and enrich peoples’ lives.
